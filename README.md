##    MINERAL CATALOG w/ DJANGO   ##
---------------------------------------------

This web application is built with the wonderful Django Web Framework.
I figured you would enjoy this catalog of fascinating minerals because, 
well, you rock!  From the homepage which lists all of our minerals, each is 
linked to a page with enhanced details that mineral. 

From a technical standpoint, here is what this Django project does:
- Raw data on minerals is stored in a JSON file.
- A custom migration (slides) that data into a Django Model.
