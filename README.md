##    MINERAL CATALOG w/ DJANGO   ##
---------------------------------------------

This web application is built with the wonderful Django Web Framework.
I figured you would enjoy this catalog of fascinating minerals because, 
well, you rock! The homepage list all the minerals in our catalog. Clicking
a mineral will send you to a page with details on that mineral. Click the icon
on the top of the page to return to the homepage at anytime. There is also an 
button at the bottom of your browser window that brings you to the detail 
page of a random mineral. Enjoy!
